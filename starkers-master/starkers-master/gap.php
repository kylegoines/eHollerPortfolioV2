                       With the Gap, “be bright” campaign we designed and created an overall smart, interactive solution that included display, video, mobile, tablet and social. This helped gain awareness for the line of skimmers and added value to the user experience. Bloggers that participated in the social solution were able to create their favorite looks with the Skimmer pants. We were able to highlight in our influencer ad unit allowing users to interact with each outfit and drive to the “Get the Look” page on the Gap website. The second phase allowed users who followed the new Gap look to try the skimmer for $20 off.
